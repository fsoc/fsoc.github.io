Tiny html+js game for learning to read.

## Note 1
The site is mostly created with intellij AI assistant to try it out, leading to a weird code-style.

## Note 2
My tiny unspash API-token is limited to 50 images / hour. There is a cache solution in place that might alleviate until my token is upgraded.
